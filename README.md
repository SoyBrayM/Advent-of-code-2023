These are my solutions to the advent of code 2023 challenges, which I am using to learn the C Language, and to
improve my problem solving skills. Surely my solutions won't be the fastest, neither the most elegant, but I will do my
best.

solutions, and improve my english writting skills, but to document my growth as a developer and, most
importantly in my opinion, my growth as a person.
