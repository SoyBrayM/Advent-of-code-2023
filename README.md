# Advent of code 2023 - Solutions

These are my solution to the advent of code 2023 challenges, which I am using to learn the C Language, and to improve my problem solving skills.
Surely my solutions won't be the fastest neither the most elegant, but I will do my best.

## Post solution analysis and thoughts

I also will be writing my thougts about what could I have done differently to solve the problems and what i would have liked to implement to do so
